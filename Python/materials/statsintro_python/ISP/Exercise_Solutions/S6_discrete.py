"""Solution for Exercise "Continuous Distribution Functions" """

# author: Thomas Haslwanter, date: Feb-2021

from scipy import stats

# Binomial distribution --------------------------------------------------
# Generate the distribution
p = 0.37
n = 15
bd = stats.binom(n, p)

# Select the interesting numbers, and calculate the
# "Probability Mass Function" (PMF)
x = [3,6,10]
y = bd.pmf(x)

# To print the result, we use the "zip" function to generate pairs of numbers
for num, solution in zip(x,y):
    print(f'The chance of finding {num} students with blue eyes '+
          f'is {solution*100:4.1f}%.')

# Poisson distribution --------------------------------------------------
# Generate the distribution.
# Watch out NOT to divide integers, as "3/4" gives "0" in Python 2.x!
prob = 62./(365./7)
pd = stats.poisson(prob)

# Select the interesting numbers, calculate the PMF, and print the results
x = [0,2,5]
y = pd.pmf(x)*100
for num, solution in zip(x,y):
    print(f'The chance of haveing {num} fatal accidents in one week '+
          f'is {solution:4.1f}%.')

# The last line just makes sure that the program does not close, when it is run
# from the commandline.
