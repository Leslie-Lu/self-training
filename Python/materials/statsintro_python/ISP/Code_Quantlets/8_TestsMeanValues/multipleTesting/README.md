Name of QuantLet: ISP_multipleTesting

Published in:  An Introduction to Statistics with Python

Description: 'Multiple testing
    This script provides an example, where three treatments are compared. It
    first performs a one-way ANOVA, to see if there is a difference between the
    groups. Then it performs multiple comparisons, to check which of the groups
    are different.

    This dataset is taken from an R-tutorial, and contains a hypothetical sample
    of 30 participants who are divided into three stress reduction treatment
    groups (mental, physical, and medical). The values are represented on a
    scale that ranges from 1 to 5. This dataset can be conceptualized as a
    comparison between three stress treatment programs, one using mental
    methods, one using physical training, and one using medication. The values
    represent how effective the treatment programs were at reducing
    participant''s stress levels, with higher numbers indicating higher
    effectiveness.
